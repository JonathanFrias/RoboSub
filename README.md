Welcome to the fun times at RoboSub! Visit us at [unfauv.org](http://unfauv.org)

Pull requests welcome! (Message me if you are not comfortable with git)

**If you do not submit code through github, we have no way to credit you for it**

## Current Proposed technology Stack

- [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) with [firmatta](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Firmata) using [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five)

- Computer vision happens with existing python code

## Getting started

- Join us on Slack! Message for an invite.

## Future plans

- Calibration based software for the following:
  - vision
  - thrusters
  - stabilization
  - PID
- Need to improve vision detection software. Resources available in software/electrical slack channels
- Currently have some proof of concept code for stabilization code

## Running the current code

- more documentation coming soon! Contact me for now!
